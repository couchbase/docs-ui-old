= Monitoring Statistics
:doctype: book

[abstract]
From the *Data Bucket* menu, information and statistics about buckets and nodes is displayed for the entire Couchbase Server cluster.
The information is aggregated from all the server nodes within the configured cluster for the selected bucket.

From the menu:Couchbase Web Console[Buckets] menu, click the menu:Statistics[] link for each bucket.

Bucket Selection::
The [.ui]*Buckets* selection list lets you select which of the buckets configured on your cluster is to be used as the basis for the graph display.
The statistics shown are aggregated over the whole cluster for the selected bucket.

Interval Selection::
Periodic Selection::
+
--
The [.ui]*Interval* selection at the top of the main graph changes interval display for all graphs displayed on the page.

As the selected interval increases, the amount of statistical data displayed will depend on how long your cluster has been running.

== Individual Bucket Monitoring

Bucket monitoring within the Couchbase Web Console has been updated to show additional detailed information.

<<summary_stats,Summary>>::
The summary section provides a quick overview of the cluster activity.

<<server_stats,Server Resources>>::
This section provides information on the server resources across the cluster.

== Admonition Blocks

Let's take a brief pause to look at some admonition blocks.

.What the admonition?
****
An admonition is a way to nudge the user to pay attention to information that is not to be missed.
It might be gentle suggestion in the form of a note or tip or something more serious like a warning.

[TIP]
This oughta do it!

[NOTE]
====
Oh, you've been down _this_ road before.

[WARNING]
====
Watch out!

I wouldn't try that if I were you.

Don't forget this step!

If you installed the CLI and the default site generator globally, you can upgrade both of them with the same command.

Now back to monitoring.

= More Monitoring

Let's get on with it.

[#summary_stats]
== Bucket Monitoring -- Summary Statistics

The summary section is designed to provide a quick overview of the cluster activity.

image::stats-summary.png[]

The following statistics are available:

.Summary statistics
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Statistic | Description

| ops per second
| The total number of operations per second on this bucket.

| cache miss ratio
| Ratio of reads per second to this bucket which required a read from disk rather than RAM.

|===

The `stale=false` view query argument has been enhanced.
When an application sends a query that has the `stale` parameter set to false, the application receives all recent changes to the documents, including changes that haven't yet been persisted to disk.

[caption="Best practice"]
TIP: For better scalability and throughput, we recommend that you set the value of the `stale` parameter to `ok`.
With the stream-based views, data returned when `stale` is set to `ok` is closer to the key-value data, even though it might not include all of it.

[#server_stats]
== Monitoring Server Resources

The *Server Resources* statistics section displays the resource information on this server including swap usage, free RAM, CPU utilization percentage,and FTS RAM used.

.A source block that is forced to wrap

// Query (fluent API)

    .query(
        N1qlQuery.simple(select("name").from("travel_sample").as("Airline").where(x("id").eq(5209)))
    );
return thisAirline;
----

[#vbucket_stats]
== Monitoring `vBucket` Resources

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Statistic | Description

| new items per sec.
a|
Number of new items created in vBuckets within the specified state.

NOTE: The new items per second is not valid for the Pending state.

| ejections per sec.
a|
* Non-zero

Number of items ejected per second within the vBuckets of the specified state.
|===

[#disk_stats]
== Monitoring Disk Queues

The *Disk Queues* statistics section displays the information for data being placed into the disk queue.

[#dcp_stats]
== Monitoring DCP Queues

[#dcp_queues,cols="1,3"]
|===
| Statistic | Description

| DCP connections
| Number of internal replication DCP connections in this bucket.

| DCP senders
| Number of replication senders for this bucket.

| DCP receivers
| Number of replication receivers for this bucket.
|===

[#view_stats]
== Monitoring View Statistics

The *View Stats* show information about individual design documents within the selected bucket.

[#index_stats]
== Monitoring Index Statistics

The INDEX STATS section provides statistics about the GSI Indexes.
Statistics are provided per each individual index.

Select `United States of America` from the menu.

[#memcached_stats]
== Memcached Buckets

For Memcached buckets, Web Console displays a separate group of statistics:

* Situation 1
.. Client 1 queries view with `stale=false`
.. Client 1 waits until server updates the index
.. Client 2 queries view with `stale=false` while re-indexing from Client 1 still in progress
.. Client 2 will wait until existing index process triggered by Client 1 completes.
Client 2 gets updated index.
* Situation 2
.. Client 1 queries view with `stale=false`
.. Client 1 waits until server updates the index
.. Client 2 queries view with `stale=ok` while re-indexing from Client 1 in progress
.. Client 2 will get the existing index
* Situation 3
.. Client 1 queries view with `stale=false`
.. Client 1 waits until server updates the index
.. Client 2 queries view with `stale=update_after`
.. If re-indexing from Client 1 not done, Client 2 gets the existing index.
If re-indexing from Client 1 is done, Client 2 gets this updated index and triggers re-indexing.

Index updates may be stacked if multiple clients request the view be updated before the information is returned (`stale=false`).
For `stale=update_after` queries, there is no stacking, since all updates occur after the query has been accessed.

=== Sequential accesses

. Client 1 queries view with stale=ok
. Client 2 queries view with stale=false
. View gets updated
. Client 1 queries a second time view with stale=ok
. Client 1 gets the updated view version

==== View operations

All views within Couchbase operate as follows:

* Views are updated as the document data is updated in memory.
** Documents that are stored with an expiry are not automatically removed until the background expiry process removes them from the database.
This means that expired documents may still exist within the index.
*** Views are scoped within a design document, with each design document part of a single bucket.
**** View names must be specified using one or more UTF-8 characters.
You cannot have a blank view name.
***** Document IDs that are not UTF-8 encodable are automatically filtered and not included in any view.
The filtered documents are logged so that they can be identified.
***** If you have a long view request, use POST instead of GET.
** Views can only access documents defined within their corresponding bucket.
You cannot access or aggregate data from multiple buckets within a given view.
*** Views are created as part of a design document, and each design document exists within the corresponding named bucket.

=== Automated index updates

If `replicaUpdateMinChanges` is set to 0 (zero), then automatic updates are disabled for replica indexes.
The trigger level can be configured both globally and for individual design documents for all indexes using the REST API.

NOTE: The `ddocs` allow you to set `updateMinChanges` or `replicaUpdateMinChanges` only via options.
The `updateInterval` can only be set for the whole cluster.

To obtain the current view update daemon settings, access a node within the cluster on the administration port using the URL `\http://nodename:8091/settings/viewUpdateDaemon`:

----
GET http://Administrator:Password@nodename:8091/settings/viewUpdateDaemon
----

----
POST http://nodename:8091/settings/viewUpdateDaemon
updateInterval=10000&updateMinChanges=7000
----

[source,json]
----
{
   "_id": "_design/myddoc",
   "views": {
      "view1": {
          "map": "function(doc, meta) { if (doc.value) { emit(doc.value, meta.id);} }"
      }
   },
   "options": {
       "updateMinChanges": 1000,
       "replicaUpdateMinChanges": 20000
   }
}
----

You can set this information when creating and updating design documents through the design document REST API.
To perform this operation using the `curl` tool:

[source,console]
----
$ curl -X POST -v -d 'updateInterval=7000&updateMinChanges=7000' \
    'http://Administrator:Password@192.168.0.72:8091/settings/viewUpdateDaemon'
----

Partial-set development views are not automatically rebuilt.
