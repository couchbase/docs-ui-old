This project contains the UI for the Couchbase documentation review site.

== Use the UI

To use this UI in an Antora-generated site, add the following configuration to your playbook:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: {uri-project}/releases/download/v{revnumber}/ui-bundle.zip
----

Read on to learn how to build the UI from source.

== Quickstart

This section offers a basic tutorial for learning how to preview the UI and bundle it for use with Antora.

=== Prerequisites

To preview and bundle the UI, you need the following software on your computer:

* {uri-git}[git] (command: `git`)
* {uri-node}[Node 8] (command: `node`)
* {uri-gulp}[Gulp CLI] (command: `gulp`)
* {uri-yarn}[Yarn] (command: `yarn`)

==== git

First, make sure you have git installed.

 $ git --version

If not, {uri-git-dl}[download and install] the git package for your system.

==== Node 8

Next, make sure that you have Node 8 installed.

 $ node --version

If this command fails with an error, you don't have Node installed.
If the command doesn't report a Node 8 version (e.g., v8.9.4), you don't have a suitable version of Node installed.

While you can install Node from the official packages, we strongly recommend that you use {uri-nvm}[nvm] (Node Version Manager) to install and manage Node.
Follow the {uri-nvm-install}[nvm installation instructions] to set up nvm on your machine.

Once you've installed nvm, open a new terminal and install Node 8 using the following command:

 $ nvm install 8

You can switch to this version of Node at any time using the following command:

 $ nvm use 8

To make Node 8 the default in new terminals, type:

 $ nvm alias default 8

Now that you have Node 8 installed, you can proceed with installing the Gulp CLI and Yarn.

==== Gulp CLI

Next, you'll need the Gulp command-line interface (CLI).
This package provides the `gulp` command which executes the version of Gulp declared by the project.

You should install the Gulp CLI globally (which resolves to a location in your user directory if you're using nvm) using the following command:

 $ npm install -g gulp-cli

==== Yarn

Finally, you'll need Yarn, which is the preferred package manager for the Node ecosystem.

You should install Yarn globally (which resolves to a location in your user directory if you're using nvm) using the following command:

 $ npm install -g yarn

Now that you have the prerequisites installed, you can fetch and build the default UI project.

=== Clone and Initialize the UI Project

Clone the default UI project using git:

[subs=attributes+]
 $ git clone {uri-project} &&
   cd "`basename $_`"

The example above clones Antora's default UI project and then switches to the project folder on your filesystem.
Stay in this project folder in order to initialize the project using Yarn.

Use Yarn to install the project's dependencies.
In your terminal, execute the following command (while inside the project folder):

 $ yarn install

This command installs the dependencies listed in [.path]_package.json_ into the [.path]_node_modules/_ folder inside the project.
This folder does not get included in the UI bundle.

=== Preview the UI

The UI project is configured to preview offline.
That's what the files in the [.path]_preview-site-src/_ folder are for.
This folder contains HTML file fragments that provide a representative sample of content from the site.

To build the UI and preview it in a local web server, run the `preview` command:

 $ gulp preview

You'll see two URLs listed in the output of this command:

....
[BS] Access URLs:
 ----------------------------------
    Local: http://localhost:5252
 External: http://192.168.1.7:5252
 ----------------------------------
[BS] Serving files from: build
[BS] Watching files...
....

Navigate to the first URL to see the preview site.

While this command is running, any changes you make to the source files will be instantly reflected in the browser.
This works by monitoring the project for changes, running the `build` task if a change is detected, and sending the updates to the browser.

Press kbd:[Ctrl+C] to stop the preview server and end the continuous build.

=== Package for Use with Antora

If you need to package the UI in order to preview the UI on the real site in local development, run the following command:

 $ gulp pack

The UI bundle will be available at [.path]_build/ui-bundle.zip_.
You can then point Antora at this bundle using the `--ui-bundle` command-line option.
